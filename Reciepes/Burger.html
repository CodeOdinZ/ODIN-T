<h3>Following are the ingredients you required in order to finalize this awsome dish,</h3>
<Ul>

<li>3 tablespoons salted butter, softened</li>
<li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
<li>8 slices thick-cut bacon</li>
<li>1½ pounds lean ground beef</li>
<li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1 tablespoon steak seasoning</li>
<li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
<li>4 large lettuce leaves</li>
<li>½ red onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced</li>

</Ul>

<p><h4>Here are the steps to follow ,</h4></p>

<ol>

<li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Butter each half of hamburger buns.                                    </li>
<li> Place bacon in a heavy skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Set the skillet aside, reserving grease.</li>
<li>Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, and steak seasoning together in a large bowl; do not overmix. Form into 4 patties. Make a thumbprint in the middle of each patty to keep it from shrinking as it cooks.                                    </li>
<li>Grill patties on the preheated grill until preferred doneness, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Top each burger with 2 slices bacon and a Cheddar cheese slice; close the grill lid until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Remove patties from the grill.</li>
<li>Place buns on the grill, buttered-side down, and cook until browned, about 1 minute. Remove from the grill. Place 1 patty on the bottom half of each bun.                                    </li>
<li>   Reheat the bacon grease in the skillet over medium-high heat. Crack eggs into the hot skillet and fry until whites are cooked but yolk is still runny, about 4 minutes. Immediately place 1 egg on top of each patty. Top with lettuce, onion, avocado, and remaining buns.                                 </li>
